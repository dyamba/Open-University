# Open University

An open-source integrated application suite designed for universities and educational institutions.

## Vision

Open University aims to provide a complete, integrated ecosystem of applications that universities need to operate effectively. Instead of purchasing expensive proprietary solutions or struggling with disconnected systems, institutions can deploy a unified platform built by the community, for the community.

## Purpose

Universities worldwide face common challenges: managing students, staff, curriculum, quality assurance, and learning resources. Commercial solutions are often expensive, inflexible, and difficult to integrate with each other.

**Open University solves this by providing:**

- A unified suite of applications that work together seamlessly
- Community-driven development focused on real educational needs
- Freedom for institutions to use, modify, and adapt the software
- Protection against commercial exploitation

## Planned Applications

| Application | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Academic Management System** | Student enrollment, curriculum management, grading, transcripts |
| **Learning Management System (LMS)** | Course delivery, assignments, online learning, assessments |
| **Human Resources (HR) App** | Staff management, payroll integration, leave management |
| **Content Management System (CMS)** | University website, announcements, document management |
| **Quality Assurance App** | Accreditation tracking, program evaluation, continuous improvement |
| **Library Management** | Catalog, borrowing, digital resources, research databases |
| **Finance Module** | Budgeting, fee collection, financial reporting |
| **Alumni Portal** | Graduate tracking, networking, fundraising |

## Core Principles

### 1. Integration First
All applications share common infrastructure, authentication, and data models. No more data silos or manual synchronization between systems.

### 2. Community Driven
Built by educators, developers, and institutions who understand the real needs of higher education.

### 3. Free for Education
Universities and educational institutions can freely use, deploy, and modify the software for their own operations.

### 4. Protected from Commercial Exploitation
While the software is open source, it cannot be sold or commercialized by vendors. Institutions benefit directly without middlemen profiting from community work.
